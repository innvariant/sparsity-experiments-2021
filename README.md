# Experiments on Properties of Hidden Structures of Sparse Neural Networks
This repository contains some accompanying code for reproducing experiments in our article on investigating properties of hidden structures of sparse neural networks.
We used and extended [deepstruct](https://github.com/innvariant/deepstruct) in this context and refined our understanding of initializing sparse networks with prior structural information.
