For our experiments, we make use of a dataset composed of Reber sequences.

We created our own dataset of **25000** true and false Reber sequences combined.
Our dataset has **12500** true Reber sequences and **12500** false, thus totaling **25000**.
Out of 25000 total sequences, our train-test set contains **18750** and **6250** sequences, respectively.

Furthermore, this train-test individually include the following number of true and false Reber sequences:
||Training set|Test set|
|---|---|---|
|**True**|9339|3161|
|**False**|9411|3089|

The visualizations corresponding to this dataset are available in the [**`plots`**](https://github.com/innvariant/sparsity-experiments-2021/tree/master/rnn/dataset/plots) folder.
